# Contributing to krabsetw
We are not currently accepting external code contributions for `krabsetw`. However, you can file issues through GitHub for bugs or feature requests and we will add them to our development backlog if we believe they meet the scope of the design.

In the future, we plan to open the code base to contributions from the community.

## Governance
At this time, all technical decisions are made by a 3-person technical committee from the OneDrive/SharePoint Security team. Feature requests and bug fixes in the form of GitHub Issues will be reviewed by this group and prioritized with other existing work assuming they're approved.

## Questions?
Please create GitHub issues for any questions you have and someone will get back to you.
